## About `twitterstream.py` 
- Used to fetch live stream data from twitter.
- Requires oauth2, which is not part of the EnThought Python library.

**Usage**
Open the program and replace access_token_key, access_token_secret, consumer_key, and consumer_secret with the appropriate values. Then run
```
$ python twitterstream.py
```
## To get credentials:
1. Create a twitter account if you do not already have one.
2. Go to [https://dev.twitter.com/apps](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) and log in with your twitter credentials.
3. Click `Create New App`.
4. Fill out the form and agree to the terms. Put in a dummy website if you don't have one you want to use.
5. On the next page, click the `API Keys` tab along the top, then scroll all the way down until you see the section `Your Access Token`;

6. Click the button `Create My Access Token`. You can [https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth](read more about Oauth authorization).

7. You will now copy four values into `twitterstream.py`.  These values are your `API Key`, your `API secret`, your `Access token` and your `Access token secret`.  All four should now be visible on the API Keys page. (You may see `API Key` referred to as `Consumer key` in some places in the code or on the web; they are synonyms.) Open `twitterstream.py` and set the variables corresponding to the api key, api secret, access token, and access secret.  You will see code like the below: 
```
api_key = "<Enter api key>"
api_secret = "<Enter api secret>"
access_token_key = "<Enter your access token key here>"
access_token_secret = "<Enter your access token secret here>"
```
- Run the following and make sure you see data flowing and that no errors occur.

```
$ python twitterstream.py > output.txt
```
This command pipes the output to a file.  Stop the program with Ctrl-C, but wait at least **3 minutes** for data to accumulate. Keep the file output.txt for the duration of the assignment; we will be reusing it in later problems.  Don’t use someone else’s file; we will check for uniqueness in other parts of the assignment.
